Enable your readers to subscribe to custom email alerts for all the topics, authors and categories of your website.

== Description ==

**Make your readers return - with Smart Email Alerts by [Followistic](http://www.followistic.com/).**

After installing the plugin your readers will find a nifty, fully customizable widget below your posts. It displays all the topics, the author and the categories of the respective post and allows your readers to select and subscribe via email to what they are most interested in on your site.

Your subscribers automatically receive an email alert with a link when you publish a new post that interests them, and only then. Therefore, the opening and click rates of the notifications we send are a lot higher than what you would get with a standard newsletter.

And to round it off, we added tons of incredibly helpful features:

* **Awesome user experience**: Let your subscribers set the frequency of notifications, select new topics to follow and unsubscribe from existing alerts, all from within their personalized dashboard.
* **Fully yours**: The widget blends perfectly into your website being fully customizable. And the email notifications to your subscribers come with your own logo matching the look'n'feel of your website. If you want to, you can further customize the notifications yourself too.
* **The extra mile**: Our notification system is packed with features: double opt-in, anti-spam optimization, fully responsive email layout, unsubscribe functionality, social media support and more.
* **Tracking at its best**: Experience our comprehensive tracking system with detailed insights of opening and click rates. Know in real time how many visitors arrived via the notifications, how many users signed up and more.
* **Lead generation**: Full access to extensive user profiles, including email addresses. With this data not only do you know who your readers are but also what they are interested in. A great resource for any sales or marketing activity. (under development)
* **Deep insights**: Find out what your readers are really interested in. With our rankings you can see which topics are most popular and our segmentation tools allow you to see what kind of reader is most interested in what kind of topic. (under development)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It places a nifty widget at the bottom of each of your posts listing the topics, the author and the categories. Your visitors can then select and subscribe via email to exactly what they are interested in.
When you publish a new post of relevance, the respective subscribers will receive an email notification with a link to your post.
Both the widget and the email notifications are fully customizable, so they'll match the look'n'feel of your website perfectly.

= What happens with the email addresses? =

All visitors subscribing to topics, authors or categories of your site will be confirmed via double opt-in. You will be able to access the email addresses collected (feature currently under development) and they are only used by us to send notifications to your subscribers when you publish a new relevant post. 

= Why do I need to register? =

Followistic is a comprehensive and neatly integrated system. It takes care of allowing your visitors to subscribe, delivering the alert notifications and showing you extensive statistics on everything.
To be able to provide you this level of functionality and service we need some basic information from you such as your email address and the URL of your WP installation. And that is what the registration is for.

= Is there a limit to the number of subscribers? =

Each email address that has been confirmed via double opt-in by its owner counts as a single subscriber. Followistic is totally free for up to 250 subscribers who can subscribe to as many topics, authors and categories as they like. Also, the number of email notifications is not limited.
Beyond 250 subscribers we offer fair monthly plans for websites of any size. You can check them our anytime [here](http://followistic.com/pricing).

= Does this plugin slow down my website? =

Not at all. All the hard work happens on our servers and the widget loads asynchronously. Therefore you do not need to worry about any speed issues at all.

= Will it blend into my site? =

Totally! You can customize the widget to match the look'n'feel of your site perfectly. The same applies to the notifications: You can make them look as if you did them yourself.

= Can I use it on multiple domains? =

Sure, the only thing you have to do is setup a different account for each domain. You'll get a separate API key for each domain then.

= I have an idea for a feature, could you please add that? =

We'd love to hear your thoughts on additional features and improvements. You can reach us anytime at [hello@followistic.com](mailto:hello@followistic.com).
